>Have you ever wanted to livestream your content to an unlimited audience and potentially monetize it? InterCollab was developed to make this process easy and accessible to everyone.

>InterCollab is here to enhance content creation, providing you with the ability to host multiple live rooms tailored to your chosen categories. You can share your audio, video, engage in chat, and exchange ideas with participants from all around the world. InterCollab offers the flexibility to create public rooms open to anyone, private rooms requiring a unique PIN provided by the creator for access, and paid rooms that necessitate users to pay a specific amount of coins for entry.
